# SSR Fix - localStorage Error Resolution

## Issue

The SlotStore was attempting to access `localStorage` during server-side rendering (SSR), which caused the following error:

```
[SlotStore] Failed to get item: ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined
    at Object.getItem (lib/stores/slot-store.ts:72:29)
```

This occurred because `localStorage` is only available in the browser, not on the Node.js server during SSR.

## Root Cause

The Zustand persist middleware with custom storage adapter was being initialized during server-side rendering, attempting to access `localStorage` before the application was hydrated on the client.

## Solution

Added `typeof window === 'undefined'` checks to all functions that access `localStorage`:

### 1. Storage Adapter Functions

```typescript
const slotStorageAdapter: StateStorage = {
  getItem: (name) => {
    // Check if we're in a browser environment
    if (typeof window === "undefined") {
      return null;
    }
    // ... rest of implementation
  },

  setItem: (name, value) => {
    // Check if we're in a browser environment
    if (typeof window === "undefined") {
      return;
    }
    // ... rest of implementation
  },

  removeItem: (name) => {
    // Check if we're in a browser environment
    if (typeof window === "undefined") {
      return;
    }
    // ... rest of implementation
  },
};
```

### 2. Helper Functions

```typescript
function getSlotMetadataFromStorage(): SlotInfo[] {
  // Check if we're in a browser environment
  if (typeof window === "undefined") {
    return Array.from({ length: SLOT_COUNT }, (_, i) => ({
      index: i,
      title: "",
      description: "",
      lastModified: "",
      isEmpty: true,
    }));
  }
  // ... rest of implementation
}

function getCurrentActiveSlotFromStorage(): number {
  // Check if we're in a browser environment
  if (typeof window === "undefined") {
    return 0;
  }
  // ... rest of implementation
}
```

### 3. Store Actions

Added the same check to all store actions that interact with localStorage:

- `setCurrentSlot`
- `saveFlow`
- `loadFlow`
- `deleteSlot`
- `editSlotMetadata`
- `migrateOldStorage`

## Result

✅ **Build successful** - No SSR errors  
✅ **Dev server clean** - No localStorage errors  
✅ **Functionality preserved** - All features work correctly in the browser  
✅ **SSR compatible** - Application can be server-side rendered safely

## Technical Details

### Why This Works

1. **Server-side**: Returns safe default values (null, empty arrays, 0) when `window` is undefined
2. **Client-side**: Normal localStorage access once the app hydrates in the browser
3. **Zustand persist**: Gracefully handles the initial null/default state and rehydrates from localStorage after mount

### No Functional Impact

- The store initializes with safe defaults on the server
- Once the app loads in the browser, the persist middleware automatically rehydrates from localStorage
- All user data and functionality remains intact

## Files Modified

- `lib/stores/slot-store.ts` - Added SSR checks to all localStorage access points

## Testing

- ✅ Production build: Successful
- ✅ Dev server: No errors
- ✅ Browser functionality: All features working
- ✅ Data persistence: Working correctly

## Best Practice

This pattern should be applied to any Zustand store that uses persist middleware with localStorage:

```typescript
// Always check for browser environment before accessing localStorage
if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
  return /* safe default value */
}

// Safe to access localStorage here
localStorage.getItem(...)
```
